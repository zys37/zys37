  I‚Äôm an electronics student in my third year at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology, specializing in signal processing systems. I've coded in python since 2019 while in high school and I took the IT Matura exam using it, later on I had basics of programming in C++ classes and later on object based C++. Now im participating in lectures like neural networks, programming in android and algorithms and data structures. Video games are my passion and I've been working on my own game assets (mainly pixel art in aseprite) and game in godot engine, but I also used unity in the past. I've uploaded these assets on unity asset store and itch.io, you can check them by clicking on the icons!

  An arcade fishing game made as a part of the Pixel Game Jam: https://itch.io/jam/-pixel-game-jam-2024
  This was a 10 day jam, this was my first jam and I think it turned out pretty OK! Had lots of fun while making this game, the experience of having so little time to figure out what to do and then to start working on it immediatly was very fun!
  You can check the game here: https://zys37.itch.io/fishin-time

# ‚öîÔ∏è Top down RPG üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÇ

  A top down RPG made with my assets in godot engine. I am using GDScript in this project, because I have used python before so it feels natural for me.
  This project  started just by making pixel art, then I decided that I may actually use this in my game, so I just started programming.
  This game contains NPCs that you can talk to, wandering enemy that chases and attacks you when get close to him. By making this game I've encouraged the state machine design pattern that I used for npcs and for the enemy.

# üöó Arcade Racer üöò

  I wanted to try something new, so I decided to make a 3D model of a car in MagicaVoxel and tried to quickly make a simple racing game. I quickly realized that I also need to download blender to animate the wheels, but after many tries the wheels do work.
  Racing games aren't really my cup of tea so I didn't add more stuff to this game, but that was my first 3D project and got lots of knowledge from it.

  # Hand Drawn Survivors

A short Vampire Survivors clone featuring my own hand-drawn graphics, three different monster types, and a few upgrades. The game speeds up as you level up, and healing salves are scattered across the map. You can try the game at [Try the game](https://zys37.itch.io/hand-drawn-survivors).

# üöì License Plate Recognition using YOLO üì∏

<img width="512" height="389" alt="Detected plate" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/130342ff-f65e-4468-aba5-b2010ef8e0e2" />

A machine learning project I did with my friend during my Neural Networks class at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. The goal was to create a system that detects license plates on images and then reads the characters written on them ‚Äì kind of like those systems used in parking garages or speed traps.

We used two YOLO models for this:
One to find the plate on a full image, and the second to detect the individual characters once the plate is cropped. We trained both from scratch using custom datasets. We've also added some image enhancement (contrast, sharpening) to help with recognition accuracy.

The final result is a script that takes a photo and gives back a string like ‚ÄúKR12345‚Äù. Super satisfying to see it work!

Here‚Äôs what the pipeline does:

    detect plate on full photo

    crop the plate out

    preprocess it (CLAHE, sharpening, etc.)

    detect characters

    sort them left to right
    combine into a single string

This was first full detection + OCR combo using YOLO that I participated in and it was a super fun project to work on. We've used python, opencv, numpy, Yolov5, pytorch and worked in google colab.

# ü§ñ Intelligent API Test Automation üöÄ

This project was all about  API testing using the power of AI. Our goal was to make API testing faster, easier, and less prone to errors by letting users describe test scenarios in natural language, then having AI generate the test steps, data, and even validate the API responses. 
As part of a four-person team, I was responsible for crafting the frontend of this system. I focused on building a lightweight and intuitive user interface using HTML and CSS. This simple, clean structure allowed for rapid testing and a smooth user experience. That was my first contact with html + CSS. It was a fantastic experience working with the guys on a real project for practical application. As for a first contact with frontend, I've really enjoyed that.
