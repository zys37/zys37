  I‚Äôm an electronics student in my third year at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology, specializing in signal processing systems. I've coded in python since 2019 while in high school and I took the IT Matura exam using it, later on I had basics of programming in C++ classes and later on object based C++. Video games are my passion and I've been working on my own game assets (mainly pixel art in aseprite) and game in godot engine, but I also used unity in the past. I've uploaded these assets on unity asset store and itch.io, you can check them by clicking on the icons!

  An arcade fishing game made as a part of the Pixel Game Jam: https://itch.io/jam/-pixel-game-jam-2024
  This was a 10 day jam, this was my first jam and I think it turned out pretty OK! Had lots of fun while making this game, the experience of having so little time to figure out what to do and then to start working on it immediatly was very fun!

# ‚öîÔ∏è Top down RPG üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÇ
  
![wioska_compressed](https://github.com/zys37/zys37/assets/157085465/0c12cfad-6dd7-40c0-ba0f-fee8502ba452)
  
  A top down RPG made with my assets in godot engine. I am using GDScript in this project, because I have used python before so it feels natural for me.
  This project  started just by making pixel art, then I decided that I may actually use this in my game, so I just started programming.
  This game contains NPCs that you can talk to, wandering enemy that chases and attacks you when get close to him. By making this game I've encouraged the state machine design pattern that I used for npcs and for the enemy.

# üöó Arcade Racer üöò

  I wanted to try something new, so I decided to make a 3D model of a car in MagicaVoxel and tried to quickly make a simple racing game. I quickly realized that I also need to download blender to animate the wheels, but after many tries the wheels do work.
  Racing games aren't really my cup of tea so I didn't add more stuff to this game, but that was my first 3D project and got lots of knowledge from it.
  Heres the video quickly showcasing the game [Watch the video](https://youtu.be/PjdkYCxhPIk)
