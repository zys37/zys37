I’m an electronics student in my second year at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. I've casually coded in python since 2019 and I took the IT Matura exam. Video games are my passion and i've been working on my own assets (mainly pixel art in aseprite) and game in godot engine, but I've also used unity in the past.
I've uploaded my assets on unity asset store and itch.io!
