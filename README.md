  I’m an electronics student in my second year at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. I've casually coded in python since 2019 and I took the IT Matura exam. Video games are my passion and I've been working on my own assets (mainly pixel art in aseprite) and game in godot engine, but I also used unity in the past. I've uploaded my assets on unity asset store and itch.io!
